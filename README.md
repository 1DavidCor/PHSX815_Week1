# PHSX815_Week1
Hello, my name is David Coria, and I am a first year graduate research assistant working in the KU ExoLab. I am familiar with Python and use it for basic plotting, fits file manipulation, and data reduction/processing. I think I'm somewhere between noob and intermediate. I am also a bit familiar with C programming, and I mean I took a one-semester course where we learned to use C. Not sure how much I remember :) AS for what topics I'd like to cover, I'm not quite sure. I feel like my current knowledge is pretty basic. I know enough to get by, but I'm very excited to learn what all there is to do!
